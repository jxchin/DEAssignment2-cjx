Version 4.0.0 of the JDBC provider added configuration options
in airflow.cfg to be configured so that based on its value
the driver_path and driver_class values set in the connection's
extra field are utilised. The definition and description of this
configuraiton is missing in provider.yaml. Adding the same here.

The `breeze setup regenerate-command-images` used hash calculation
to determine when to regenerate commands. There was only one file
with hashes for all commands which often cause conflicts if several
people changed adjacent commands. Also when one of the subcommands
changed, this immediately invalidated the ""parent"" command where
the subcommand was, however such invalidation is only needed if
a new subcommand is added or if name or help description of the
subcommand changes - because this is the only information displayed
in the parent command.

This PR improves hash calculation and verification and calculation
to avoid conflicts as much as possible. The hash will only have
conflict when the same command is modified by the same people in
parallel (signifying that indeed you need to regenerate the image
for that command). This is achieved by:

* splitting hashes to separate files - each command has its own
  .txt file where hash of the command is kept

* when hash of the group command is calculated, only name and
  help text of the subcommands for the group are used to calculate
  hash","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-08T08:13:10Z"

* Use None instead of empty data structures when no ElasticSearch logs

Previously, when there were no logs, we would just use [] or {} and continue to process them through functions such as ""group by host"" and such.  But if no logs are found, it's odd to go down those paths.

One example of the confusion is the return type in `es_read` was `list | ElasticSearchResponse`.  This makes it look like it would either be a list (presumably of logs?) or an ElasticSearchResponse object (presumably also containing logs?).  But in reality, the only time list was returned, was when there _were no logs at all!_  This was just to adhere to the contract that we handle ""no logs"" the same as ""logs"".  _(And it turns out that ElasticSearchResponse magically also behaves like at iterable which is also confusing but that's a separate issue.)_

The Qubole provider has been agreed to be removed. We need to release
one more relese for it with the message in the documentation and readme
that it has been removed. This change adds necessary changes to release
management process that release manager can specify such suspended
provider to be released - both as a package and as documentation being
built - by manually specifying such provider when:

* preparing documentation
* preparing relases
* building documentation
* publishing documentation

Generally it works in the way that:

* suspended providers are not visible as options or autocomplete in the
  corresponding commands or is not included in case ""all"" providers are
  chosen by any of the commands.
* but when you specifically type the suspended provider as argument
  or filter in any of the relevant commands, the action will be performed

By default static checks run in the CI with `--all-files` to make
sure that there are no side-effects coming from only running the
pre-commit checks on a subset of files. The complete `--all-files`
static check suite on self-hosted runners take ~ 9 minutes and
for public runners take ~ 15 minutes so there is room for optimisation
now that Tests are running faster than that in many cases.

While we cannot run static checks on only the files changed in the
PR (that would lead to many false-positives) we can disable whole
pre-commit checks in case the incoming PRs do not contain certain
files modified. For example we we can skip mypy-providers
when no provider files changed, or we can skip mypy-core when no
core files changed or we can skip helm linting in case chart files
have not changed in the incoming PR.

This PR implements selective check rules that will skip some of the
longest running pre-commit checks in case it looks like the checks
are not needed.

Still - all tests will be run when ""full tests needed"" flag is set
(i.e. when build scripts change or when we detect structural/package
changes in the project or when ""full tests needed"" label is set for
the PR - and all the static checks will also continue running in
""canary"" builds, so we will be able to catch and correct any rules
that will lead to skipping some of the static checks when they should
be run in fact.

Also the cache for pre-commits is renamed to be ""common"" - currently
the ""basic"" cache is different than full cache but since cache is
only really uploaded by the ""canary"" builds, it's quite ok to
have a common ""full""cache - it will get faster to retrieve it by
regular PRs.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-07T16:23:58Z"

Debian bookworm (12) is the current stable version of Debian and
it is on the market for more than a year so all the other
dependencies should have enough time to catch up.

While Debian bullseye is still supported (oldstable) it will
be switching to LTS support mode (managed by volunteers) roughly in
July 2024 - but we want to switch our reference images
to bookworm long before that date.

This PR switches our reference images to Debian Bookworm for
Dockerfiles and images that will be released to Airflow 2.8.0.

Similarly as with ""Debian buster -> Debian bullseye"" switch we
will switch our reference images to bookworm and we will not be
publishing images based on bullseye. However our users will still
be able to build custom images using our Dockerfiles with bullseye base
image until we release Airflow 2.9.0 where the bullseye support will
be dropped entirely.

We provide release notes and instructions on how users can build
the bullseye images if they still want to do it - for example
because their system level dependencies will require them to do so,
but the users are advised to switch to bookworm-based images as soon
as possible.

The users will likely still be able to build custom Airflow images for
future airflow releases (using Dockerfiles released with Airlfow 2.8),
however as of Airflow 2.9, we will not release Dockerfiles with support
for that and we will not verify if Airflow with default depenencies can
be installed on bullseye Debian.

We were always building PROD image when we built CI image on CI as
we had only one flag ""build-images"" in selective checks. This was
based on an assumption that we want to still run docker compose
tests with airflow when any of our sources change - just to see if
it still works.

While ""docker-compose"" tests are the only end-to-end tests it is
very unlikely that unit and integration tests passing will trigger
a docker compose test failure.

This of course might happen, but if it happens, we will find out during
our canary builds that run all the tests and building PROD image in this
case is a waste of resources and time - waiting for docker-compose tests
to complete when we really do not have to do it makes no sense either.
Even if those tests are relatively quick, just waiting for PROD images
being built (PROD images have to wait for CI images in order to get
constraints from CI builds) adds quite a bit of elapsed test time for
many smaller PRs that do not change k8s or Helm in any way.

This change splits ""image-build"" into two outputs of selective checks:
ci-image-build and prod-image-build. The CI-image build is the same
as before - we will build CI image whenever any test need to use the
image and run our code (so for example it is false when only
README files change). PROD image build is set to true now only when
we need kubernetes tests (i.e. when k8s provider changes) or when chart
changes - because there we want to test basic functionality of k8s
integration and Helm deployment/running.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-04T17:05:28Z"

Turns out that some of the layers in our PROD image got
invalidated because AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_MODE used to build the
cache for PROD image is ""constraints"" by default, while building
images in ""build-images"" workflow for regular PRs and canary
build uses ""constraints-source-providers"". The former is fine as
default for PROD image (as oppose to CI image we build PROD image
from released PyPI packages by default) but the latter is ""proper""
for the CI cache, because there, the image is built out of local
packages prepared from sources.

Turns out that the CONSTRAINT_MODE parameter had a profound impact
on caching - because it was set before the
""install_packages_from_branch_tip"" step and - in fact - even
before ""install database clients"" step, which caused our cache to
only work for the ""base OS dependencies"" - installing database
clients and installing airflow from branch tip (which works great
for CI image) had always been done in PRs because the layers in
cache with constraints env invalidated all subsequent layers.

This had no big impact before when testing usually took much longer
time - but since the testing has been vastly improved in #35160, now
PROD image building continues running even after test complete and
becomes the next frontier of optimization.

This PR optimizes PROD image building in two ways:

* caching is prepared with ""source_providers"" constraint mode, same
  as regular build

* the AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINT_MODE and related arguments are moved after
  installing database clients, so that this parameter does not
  impact their caching.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-04T15:58:55Z"

* Truncate Wasb storage account name if it's more than 24 characters

Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length but for some
reasons that I can't explain, we saw a situation where the storage name is more than 24 characters
and had to be truncated before it could work. Maybe it was possible in the past to have more than 24 characters or
it could come from cluster but whichever way, the solution that worked was truncating the account name to
24 characters.

There was an edge case with race condition between merging the
setup.py change to main and refreshing constraint causing a failure
of PROD image building when the new setup.py had conflicting
dependencies with the past constraints. This happened on Aug 28
with azure-mgmt-containerinstance which got upgrade to a new 8.0.0
version which was conflicting with previous setup.py:

* azure-mgmt-containerinstance>=1.5.0,<2.0

to

* azure-mgmt-containerinstance>=7.0.0,<9.0.0

The problem was that PROD builds used the constraints from main
to build the image, because constraints were not produced in the
CI builds for the same job (constraints wer only produced in the
PR that had ""upgrade to newer depedencies"".

The regular PR CI builds have a build-in protection against such
edge case - they run with `--upgrade-on-failure` flag that causes
the PRs to upgrade their constraints eagerly if they fail on
constraints failure.

This PR fixes the edge case by utilising the result of the
flag --upgrade-on failure.

After this PR, constraints will always be uploaded by CI jobs,
not only when ""upgrade to newer dependencies"" PR is run. this means
that when CI build falls back as result of `--upgrade-on-failure`
the newly generated constraints are uploaded as artifacts and used
by PROD image build.

As a side-effect, every PR will produce the constraints used by
that build as artifact. This is actually pretty good thing for
diagnosis of dependency problems.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-28T20:38:26Z"

As the name suggests, this test should verify that a task is not adopted if it belongs to a DAG which is not in RUNNING state.

Before this change: the test setup creates a DAG in RUNNING state, but the test passes because the task has queued_by_job_id set to a live scheduler (so is not adoptable for a different reason - it's not an orphan). It looks l
ike it was a copy-paste from the previous test case (test_reset_orphaned_tasks_no_orphans) which is supposed to test this scenario.

After this change: the test setup is aligned with the test name - the task is an orphan but its DAG is not running so the task cannot be adopted.

Publishing documentation is quite slow when preparing multiple

Hhowever we can easily speed it up by parallelising the publishing

add redirections for new pages in the old documentation, so that
user browsing the page can change version without hittin 404 error.

This command was not run in CI and some refactorings could break
it (as it already happened in #33626 - fixed by #33790).

Most other breeze commands are already run in CI, so this one should
be no different.

This PR adds back-reference generation as part of our regular
documentation building step.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-27T06:13:55Z"

The #33626 change missed an edge case where back reference new
link was in the top-level folder and crashed with ValueError.

Unfortunately back-reference command is one that we do not run (yet)
in CI to verify if it works, because we need a checked-out airflow-site
for it, so such errors might go unnoticed. However this error is an
indication that we likely should add it to CI - in order to avoid
situation when the command is expected to be working at release
time.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-27T04:32:51Z"

There were still some left-overs of EAGER_UPGRADE in PROD image
building. Howwever ""eager upgrade"" only makes sense for CI images.
PROD images when being built should use eager upgrades as they
are produced in the CI image step.

This PR does the following:

* removes eager upgrade parameters from PROD image
* instead, prod image build has a new flag for installing
  the images: --use-constraints-for-context-packages which will
  automatically use constraints from ""docker-context-files"" if
  they are present there.
* modifies the CI workflows to upload constraints as artifacts
  and download them for PROD image build when ""eager upgrade""
  has been used and directs it to use ""source"" constraints
* adds back support to ""upgrade to newer dependencies"" label
  that makes it easy to test ""eager upgrade""

As the result, when PROD image is build in CI:

* when regular PR is run, it will use latest github ""source"" constraints
* whwn ""eager upgrade"" PR is run, it will use the eager-upgrade
  constraints that were generated during CI build","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-26T22:14:18Z"

The new version of autossh installed yesterday when our AMI has
been refreshed is a little less verbose when printing AUTOSSH_LOG
entries. So far it produced entries for starting and running the
autossh - which was not intersting if nothing was wrong:

```

2023/08/21 06:33:27 autossh[31898]: ssh child pid is 31899
```

The new versio will not produce any output and wont even create
a file when nothing wrong happens and this caused our CI
to fail at the very last moment - after the ARM instance has
been stopped.

* Improve detection of when breeze CI image needs rebuilding

Previously we have been using provider.yaml file modification as
a sign that the docker image needs rebuilding when starting image.
However just modification of provider.yaml file is not a sign
that the image needs rebuilding. The image needs rebuilding when
provider dependencies changed, but there are many more reasons why
provider.yaml file changed - especially recently provider.yaml
file contains much more information and dependencies are only part
of it. Provider.yaml files can also be modified by release manager
wnen documentation is prepared, but none of the documentation
change is a reason for rebuilding the image.

This PR optimize the check for image building introducing two
step process:

* first we check if provider.yaml files changed
* if they did, we regenerate provider dependencies by manully
  running the pre-commit script
* then provider_dependencies.json is used instead of all providers
  to determine if the image needs rebuilding

This has several nice side effects:

* the list of files that have been modified displayed to the
  user is potentially much smaller (no provider.yaml files)
* provider_dependencies.json is regenereated automatically when
  you run any breeze command, which means that you do not have
  to have pre-commit installed to regenerate it
* the notification ""image needs rebuilding"" will be printed less
  frequently to the user - only when it is really needed
* preparing provider documentation in CI will not trigger
  image rebuilding (which might occasionally fail in such case
  especially when we bring back a provider from long suspension
  like it happened in #33574

We used to have problems with `pip` backtracking when we relaxed
too much open-telemetry dependencies. It turned out that the
backtracting was only happening on Python 3.8 and that it was
ultimately caused by conflict between importlib_metadata between
Airflow and newer versions of opentelemetry (we had <5 for Python
3.8, they had >6 for all versions. The reason for limiting it in
Airflow was Celery that was not working well with importlib 5.

Since Celery 5.3 solved the problems (released 6th of June) we can
now relax the importlib_metadata limit and set Celery to version >=
5.3.0) which nicely resolves the conflict and there is no more
backtracking when trying to install newer versions of opentelemetry
for Python 3.8.

docker-compose features (for example in #33547). Also docker-compose
v1 is sufficiently old an unmaintained, that it's about time to
get rid of it and ask the users to migrate to docker-compose v2.

The new min versions propose:

* Docker: 23.0.0 released 2023-02-01 (6 months ago)
* Docker Compose 2.14.0 release 2022-12-15 (8 months ago)

Docker v1 is not supported any more and the users are directed
to migrate to v2 to continue using Breeze.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-21T15:43:44Z"

* Fix updating account url for WasbHook

There are different ways users supply the hostname(account url) in azure,
sometimes the host doesn't have a urlparse.scheme but has urlparse.path e.g name.blob.windows.net
and other times, it will just be Azure ID e.g aldhjf9dads.
While working on #32980, I assumed that if there's no scheme, then the hostname is not valid, that's
incorrect since DNS can serve as the host.
The fix was to check if we don't have netloc and that urlparse.path does not include a dot and if it does not, use the login/account_name to construct
the account_url

Even the latest pip can enter into a long loop of backtracking
when trying to find latest ""good"" set of dependencies with
eager upgrade. This happened on August 10th 2023 with aiobotocore
causing backtracking.

This PR adds a complete set of tools and instructions that can
help in such cases and figure out which newly released dependency
causes backtracking.

The toolset consists of:

* adding timeout on the image build, so that it can fail before
  the job timeout and provide useful instructions what to do

* adding `ci find-backtracking-candidates` that allows to identify
  the packages released after the last successful constraint update
  that could be the reason for backtracking

* running the `find-backtracking-candidates` command in the CI
  when timeout occurs - this will help to see the candidates as
  early as possible - at the first build that will fail with
  timeout. This should help with narrowing down the root cause
  much faster

* adding detailed explanation why we have the problem and how to
  deal with it step-by-step, including example based on the
  August 2023 backtracking issue with aiobotocore

* finally removing `--empty-image` switch and pushing empty images
  in CI. This was an attempt to speed up waiting for image in case
  the image failed, but what it did, it has hidden the failures
  of the images when they failed. It does not really add value
  any more, since ""image waiting"" is now always done using small
  public runners, waiting till timeout for those is not a big issue.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-14T08:41:48Z"

* Remove user sessions when resetting password

When user's password is reset, we also remove all DB sessions
for that user - for database session backend.

In case we are using securecookie mechanism, resetting password does
not invalidate old sessions, so instead we are displaying warning to
the user performing the reset that in order to clear existing
sessions of the user, the secure_key needs to be changed and it
will invalidate all sessions for all users.

Protection has been added in case the number of sessions in the DB
is too big to effectively scan and remove sessions for the user. In
such case we print warning for the user that sessions have not
been reset, and we suggest to improve the way their deployment
mechanisms create too many sessions - by either changing the way
how automation of the API calls is done and/or by purging the
sessions regularly by ""airflow db clean"".

setting values to the config param other than `Disabled`, enables the

The check was done via `git log --grep=#PR` essentially and so
it happenes that `--grep` matches not only the first line of
the message but the whole log message. So if the log message
contained reference to the cherry-picked PR it was seen as merged.

This change adds ( ) around and $ to the regexp to match not
only the PR number but also parentheses around.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-09T15:41:06Z"

This commit makes pools consider deferred tasks if the `include_deferred` flag is set. By default a pool will not consider deferred tasks as occupied slots, but still show the number of deferred tasks in its stats.

The dask_executor backfill tests started to fail recently more often due
to backfill exception, and the likely cause for it is that it is now
better parallelise execution and triggering of the deadlocks because of
contention betwee dag_run state update and task state update had
become much easier.

While this PR does not fix the underlying issue, it catches the
operational error where the deadlock occured during the backfill.
and rolls back the operation.

This **should** be safe. backfil has a built-in mechanism to loop and
retry failed tasks and the test passed multiple times, completing the
backfill after this fix was applied. It was not easy to reproduce it
locally but it failed every 20-30 times. When extra logging was added,
it was always connected to OperationalException raised (and caught)
right after _per_task_process. The same exception was observed few times
when rollback was added, and despite it backfill job retried and
completed the process successfully every time. We also leave the logs
with exceptions and add reassuring messages that should make it clear
that in case backfill completes, the exceptions can be ignored as
the updates will be retried by the backfill job.

The dnspython and Flask Application Builder have a weird transitive
dependency to openssl. It does not require it - it is an optional
dependnency of email validator that uses dnspython and the dnspython
uses pyopenssl when installed. This is all fine. But when opendns
is used with older FAB < 4.1.4) and NEWER opensl (>=23.0), just
creating the FAB applicatio in flask causes an exception than
there is a missing parameter in openssl.

Since openssl is NOT declared as required dependency in neither FAB
nor dnspython, installing airflow with constraints while
having a newer version of pyopenssl does not downgrade pyopenssl
it is just mentioned in a conflicting message resulting from conflicts
with other packages already installed (such as cryptography).

This caused a problem when installin older airflow version in breeze
with --use-airflow-version switch.

Also - during checking this issue, it turned out that we were not
- by default - using the constraints for older version when installing
it in breeze (you could do that by explicitly specifying the
constraints). This was because when you used anoter way to specify
versio (commit hash, tag) it is quite complex to figure out which
constraints to use. However we can automatically derive constraints
when you specify version, or branch, which are the most common
scenarios.

This PR fixes the `--use-airflow-version` case for Airflow 2.4 and below
by:

* automatically deriving the right constraints when version or branch
  are used in `--use-airflow-version`

* adding pyopenssl specifically as dependency when
  --use-airflow-version switch is used.

* also a small quality of life improvment - when airflow db migrate
  fails (because old versio of airflow does not support it) - we inform
  the user that it happened and that we are attempting to run the
  legacy airflow db init instead.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-07T19:28:40Z"

In #32810, ""airflow db migrate"" command has been added and it
is used by `start-airflow` command. There were a few edge cases
not covered and this PR completes it.

* We can move the ""database/load_default_connections"" configuration
  to a new ""deprecated"" section. This is the first time we remove
  the option completely as it lost its meaning, but we likely
  still want to explain that the option was there and what it does
  when deprecated ""db init"" command is used.

It has no meaning when you use ""airflow db migrate"" or when you run the
new ""airflow connections create-default-connections"" commands. So we can
now remove it completely from configuraiton. It will still work
in the ""airflow db init"" which is deprecated, as long as we provide an
explicit fallback. Also if someone had it defined in their config or
env variable, it will continue to work even if it is not defined.

* We need to explain the change in a significant newsfragment.

* The ``start-airflow`` command supports creating default connections
  with ``--load-default-connections`` flag. This was lost after
  the change so this PR brings it back by running the new
  ""airflow connections create-default-connections"" command if the
  flag is used.

* The `start-airflow` breeze command can be used to start older
  versions of airflow - with ``--use-airflow-version"" - those that do not
  support `airflow db migrate` command. In this case the old behaviour is
  used with setting the ""AIRFLOW__DATABASE__LOAD_DEFAULT_CONNECTIONS""
  based on the flag passed and running ""airflow db init"" instead.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-05T22:19:45Z"

Recently sqlite started to fail randomly during teardown of
`test_xcom_map_nest` or `test_xcom_map_zip_nest`. This happpened
after adding `test_xcom_map_zip_nest` . It looked very strange:

```
sqlite3.ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be
used in that same thread

By analysing possible reasons it seems that it was a side effect
of the existing `test_xcom_map_nest` that allocated a new
session in the run method of task instance rather than pass
the sesion that is created and torrn down in the pytest fixture.

The hypothesis is that the session created in the ``test_xcom_map_nest``
were being reclaimed and closed while the `test_xcom_map_zip_nest` test
was already starting in a different thread started by Pytest.

The PROD image verification happens after the images are pulled
in the ""wait for PROD images"" step. This verification is pretty
helpful in detecting cases where there are some ""installed airflow""
problems (for example recently it helped to avoid a circular import
problem in #33081 as one of the tests failed when images were
verified. However PROD image wait might fail for other reasons and
sometimes might be ""neglected"" as temporary failure.

Separating verification will allow to clearly surface that the
problem is with verification, not pulling the images.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-05T16:03:39Z"

The openlineage provider has apache-airflow >= 2.7.0 as dependency,
and this is a problem for automated constraint generation. Since there
is only one version of the provider released, it's the only one that
can be installed from PyPI, but until apache-airflow 2.7.0 is released
it cannot be installed because of the dependency missing.

This makes calculating of the constraints by PyPI impossible and it
loops in continuously trying to find a solution that cannot be found.

In order to unblock constraint generation we need to exclude the
provider temporarily and regenerate the constraints again when airflow
2.7.0 gets released (which will generally only bring the open-lineage
provider as part of the constraints).

It is observed that urljoin is not yielding expected results for
the task instance's log_url which needs to be a concatenation of the
webserver base_url and specified relative url. The current usage
of urljoin does not seem to be the right way to achieve this based
on what urljoin is meant for and how it works. So, we use simple
string concatenation to yield the desired result.

* Refactor account_url use in WasbHook

This PR moves the account_url setting to one place.
Tested this by making connection to azure using the different methods, however, I was not able to connect using
the tenant_id in the extra field. This looks like a bug because ClientSecretCredential is not among the credentials
to use in BlobServiceClient. The credentials to use include AzureNamedKeyCredential,AzureSasCredential,AsyncTokenCredential.
So this will need special debugging.

The new security page of ours looked a bit messy - mixing the security

security topics.

This change cleans it up quite a bit:

* ""Airflow Security Model"" and ""Releasing security patches"" are
  separated out - each to a separate page focusing only on model/release
  respectively

* The index now does not contain everything mixed together - both in

We ask our contributors to test pre-release candidates for Airflow

mix&match versions of airflow and providers that can be installed
when running `breeze shell` or `breeze start-airflow` - which

So far we only applied PyPi suffix for cross-provider dependencies -
i.e. when one airflow package depended on another one released at
the same time we added ""dev0"" suffix to their cross-dependencies,
when building them on CI so that they can be installed together
without conflicts (this is because of decisions made with PEP-440
where version suffixes are in different namespaces than the final
versions, so it is impossible to specify ""final"" dependency as
minimal and have the "".dev0"" satisfy it only for that single package.

With openlineage provider, we need to release it before Airflow 2.7.0
gets released, and openlineage provider depends on Airflow 2.7.0 so
we need to also handle the situation, where OpenLineage has >= 2.7.0
for Airflow, but the dependency that is used to resolve dependencies
in CI uses 2.7.0dev0. This is done by dynamically manipulating the
dependencies in setup.py based on VERSION_SUFFIX_FOR_PYPI variable.

This variable in CI is set to ""dev0"" thus all packages built have
""dev0"" added as version, with this change if any package has
>= <CURRENT_AIRFLOW_VERSION> specified, it will also be extended
with the same ""dev0"" suffix.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-27T21:16:29Z"

* Fix broken getting webserver config file from settings.WEBSERVER

At the point of creating the webserver app, settings.WEBSERVER returns an empty
string. This started after this commit: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/6362ba5ab45a38008814616df4e17717cc3726c3
and I wonder why we are not getting this value from the airflow configuration?
I think the airflow config file should be the source of truth for anything configuration, so I'm changing it to get
the configuration from airflow config file while we look for a fix for the settings.WEBSERVER being empty.

The current problem with not getting value from settings.WEBSERVER means that changes in webserver_config are not picked by
airflow. So if you want to enable user registration for example, it will fail. This fixes it.

* Quarantine test_backfill_integration in dask executor

The test has been recently failing with deadlock (see #32778) and
needs thorough looking at if we want to find the root cause/remedium.

In the meantime it looks like a niche case connected with Dask
Executor that is rather obsure and we have no expertise in solving
problems with and diagnosing, so until the problem is diagnosed
it might be a long time (and maybe even we decide not to care
about it and let Dask community take a look and either fix or
ignore it.

We aim to have a very low number of those Quarantined tests
(currently we have 1 and we have not run it for a while as this
was a mysql test run on Postgres) but we have now the opportunity
to also improve the quarantined tests framework.

This test will be run together with other (1) quarantined test and:

* they will not be run in our regular tests
* they are run sequentially not in parallel with all other tests
* they are run for all 4 backends but only for the default
  versions of those backends
* failure of the quarantined tests will not cause failure of the
  whole job or limit constraints from being generated and updated

* Add pre-Airflow-2-7 hardcoded defaults for config for older providers

During thorough testing and review of moving configuration to provoders
I realised that there was a case that was not handled properly. In some
cases some providers and DAGs could rely on some default values being
available as default, but when we move them from core, and use older
version of provider those defaults were not available:

* they were remove as defaults in core
* the old providers did not have ""config"" section to contribute the
  defaults

This would be a breaking change and old providers (Celery, K8s) could
fail - as it happened in some tests.

This PR implements a nice solution to that, also allowing to remove
some manual fallbacks in Celery and Kubernetes executor code.

The solution is to add a hard-coded ""pre-2.7"" configuration which
would only contain ""provider"" pre-2.7 hard-coded defaults and make
it a fallback option if the values are neither set nor defaults
contributed by the providers.

We do not have to maintain those - the defaults are ""frozen""
effectively at the values available just before 2.7. The nice side
effect is that we can remove a number of fallbacks, because this
hard-coded configuration becomes the fallback automatically,

That entirely solves the case where you want to install older
providers on 2.7 where config.yml does not contain those provider
values.

Executor that is rather obsure and we have no expertise in solving

* Allow FileTaskHandler to delegate to instances of logging.Handler

FileTaskHandler is the base class for logging handlers, including those that
don't log to files via delegating to logging.FileHandler, e.g. in the
CloudwatchTaskHandler at
https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2940b9fa55a6a72c60c2162e541631addec3d6b8/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/log/cloudwatch_task_handler.py#L67

It is suspected that type checking is not enabled in this part of the
CloudwatchTaskHandler otherwise it would have already been failing.

This change adjusts the base class so if type checking is enabled in the task
handler, if it delegates to a logging.Handler that is not a logging.FileHandler
as the CloudWatchHandler, then the type checking should pass.

This was originally part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31855 and
split out.

* Add Redis task handler

This stores log lines in Redis up to a configured maximum log lines, always
keeping the most recent, up to a configured TTL.

This deviates from other existing task handlers in that it accepts a connection
ID. This allows it to be used in addition to other handlers, and so allows a
graceful/reversible transition from one logging system to another.

This is particularly useful in situations that use Redis as a message broker,
where additional infrastructure isn't desired.

A number of commands in Airflow relies on the fact that
providers configuration is loaded. This is a rather fast operation
as it does not involve any importing of provider classes, just
discovering entrypoints, running them and parsing yaml configuration,
so it is a very low sub-second time to do it.

We cannot do it once in settings/config because we actually need
settings/config to be pre-initialized without providers in order
to be able to bootstrap airflow, therefore we need to run
it individually in each command that can be run with the
""airflow"" entrypoint. Decorator seems to be best suited to do
the job:

* easy to apply and not easy to forget when you create another
  command and look at other commands
* nicely wraps around local ProvidersManager import

There are exceptions for the ""version"" and ""providers lazy-loaded""
commands because they are NOT supposed to initialize configuration
of providers.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-22T19:38:58Z"

* Allow configuration to be contributed by providers

The changes implemented:

* provider.yaml files for providers can optionally contribute extra
  configuration, the configuration is exposed via ""get_provider_info""
  entrypoint, thus allowing Airflow to discover the configuration
  from both - sources (in Breeze and local development) and from
  installed packages

* Provider configuraitions are lazily loaded - only for commands that
  actually need them

* Documentation for configuration contributed by providers is
  generated as part of Provider documentation. It is also discoverable
  by having a ""core-extension"" page displaying all community providers
  that contribute their own configuration.

* Celery configuration (and in the future Kubernetes configuration) is
  linked directly from the airflow documentation - the providers are
  preinstalled, which means that celery (and Kubernetes in the future)
  configuration is considered as important to be directly mentioned
  and linked from the core. Similarly Celery and Kubernetes executor
  documentation remains in the core documentation (still configuration
  options are detailed only in the provider documentation and only
  linked from the core.

* configuration writing happens in ""main"" not in the configuration
  initialization and we will always execute provider configuration
  initialization. This will make sure that the generated configuration
  will contain configuration for the providers as well.

* Related documentation about custom and community providers have been
  updated and somewhat refactored - I realized that some of it was quite
  out-of-date and some of it was really ""developer"" not user docs.
  The docs are restructured a bit, cleaned, missing information is
  added and old/irrelevant parts removed.

Workaround an issue with installing pymssql on ARM architecture
triggered by Cython 3.0.0 release as of 18 July 2023. The problem is
that pip uses latest Cython to compile pymssql and since we are using
setuptools, there is no easy way to fix version of Cython used to
compile packages.

This triggers a problem with newer `pip` versions that have build
isolation enabled by default because There is no (easy) way to pin build
dependencies for dependent packages. If a package does not have  limit
on build dependencies, it will use the latest version of them to build
that particular package.

The workaround to the problem suggest in the last thread by Pradyun
Gedam - pip maintainer - is to use PIP_CONSTRAINT environment variable
and constraint the version of Cython used while installing
the package. Which is precisely what we are doing here.

Note that it does not work if we pass ``--constraint`` option to pip
because it will not be passed to the package being build in isolation.
The fact that the PIP_CONSTRAINT env variable works in the isolation is
a bit of side-effect on how env variables work and that they are passed
to subprocesses as pip launches a subprocess `pip` to build the package.

This is a temporary solution until the issue is resolved in pymssql or
Cython.

"faa8f543d5f7bf7113076dab5f579493ec2860ec","https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/commits/faa8f543d5f7bf7113076dab5f579493ec2860ec","Store config description in Airflow configuration object (#32669)

We would like to use the config.yml approach as our main source of truth
for airflow configuration. So far it has been split amongst multiple
files:

  * confg.yml -> descroption
  * default_airflow.cfg -> JINJA template to keep cofiguration, examples
    and description (used to generate airflow.cfg when airflow starts)
  * default_test.cfg -> storing test-only configuration used in some
    test cases - used to generate unittest.cfg
  * scripts/in_container/airflow_ci.cfg where dCI-specific configuration
    overwrote the unittest.cfg

This change consolidates it all into unified appraoch, where all
configuration information is retrieved from .yml files stored in
config_templates. No more additional template files processed by
JINJA, no more special CI versions of it, no more unittestdb.cfg file
where such configuration would be generated, no more unittestdb to
be used separately for tests.

* The default_*.cfg files were not real configuration files, becuase
  they were really JINJA templates and it got peoeple confused when
  copying the files. This change leaves the file empty with the
  comment that instructs the user how they can get the default
  configuration.
* The default_airflow.cfg is gone and instead, we have a way to
  show defaults via `airflow config list --defaults` command
* Unittest config is generated on-the-flight using defaults stored
  in confg_templates. constituing a single place where they need
  to be changed for the tests to use them
* internally, description of the configuration is stored in
  AirflowConfigurationParser and used by the parser to generate
  the default configuration when needed.
* we got rid of `{{{{` in templated config defaults by marking
  the templates with ``is_template`` and getting rid of processing
  those entries with regular formatting when generating the default
  values. This only concerns defaults from config.yml. Reading
  those configuration entries from file is unaffected.

This change aims to be 100% backwards compatible with the previous
implementation when it comes to functionality, even if internals
changed. It also does not add provider-specific changes that are
coming separately.

The only changes visible to the user are:

* generated airflow.cfg is slightly more
  readable and displays names of variables that can be used to override
  each configuration (which is very useful for copy&pasting)

* user are advised, instead of copying the default_airflow.cfg to use
  `airflow config list --defaults` to generate production config. This
  configuration has all the entries commented out, so that they can
  selectively uncomment and change the values they want. This is now
  promoted as ""best practice"" in the documentation.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-20T06:20:23Z"

ProvidersManager might get accidentally initialized during CLI
argument parsing, and if it does, then CLI and arg completion
takes huge performance hit - it takes seconds to intialize
ProvidersManager when you have many providers packages installed,
so initializing ProvidersManager should not happen just when you
parse arguments of the CLIs but only when you execute commands.

It's rather easy to trigger ProvidersManager by just importing
some package (especially as we move executors to providers).

This PR adds a new CLI command in providers to check status of
initialization - this command will fail when provider's initlalization
is executed during CLI parsing. It will also show the stack
trace of where ProvidersManager has been initialized from.

Test is added to detect such situation by running the new command
in a separate subprocess, thus making sure ProvidersManager has not
been initialized in another test.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-19T16:13:38Z"

The cassandra hack added in #30315 does not seem to have a chance to get
away. Neither Pytest https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10844
nor Datastax https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/1142
want to own the problem for now (though there is a proposal from
pytest contributors on how Datastax could refactor their code to
avoid the problem)

However during the discussion an idea popped in my head on how
we could come back to test_* pattern with far less probability of
missing some tests that are added to wrong files. Seems that we
can add a fixture that will outright fail tests if they are
placed if files not following the test_* pattern. While it would
not help in case test would be wrongly named in the first place,
it would definitely help to not to add more tests in wrongly named
files because it will be literally impossible to run the tests
added in a wrong file, even if you manualy do `pytest somefile.py`
and avoid running collection.

I also did a quick check to try to find cases where the test_*
file name was already violated and I found (and renamed) two that
I have found. It seems it is quite likely that similar mistake
could be done in the future - but with the fixture I added it
should be far less likely someone adds tests in a wrongly named
file.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-15T20:58:17Z"

* Support setting dependencies for tasks called outside TaskGroup context manager

Currently, you must instantiate a classic operator or call a decorated
operator inside the context manager before it will link up with the context manager.
For example, tasks 1 and 2 below will be outside the group1 context:
```
   task1 = BashOperator(task_id=""task1"", bash_command=""echo task1"")
   task2 = BashOperator(task_id=""task2"", bash_command=""echo task2"")
   with TaskGroup('group1'):
        task1 >> task2
```
This PR addresses the above such that when you do that, the tasks will
be inside the group1 context.
For a single task, you can do:
```
   task1 = BashOperator(task_id=""task1"", bash_command=""echo task1"")
   with TaskGroup('group1') as scope:
        scope.add(task1)

Also, did a little optimization so that most of the time we don't need to create an intermediate list of to-be-skipped task in this operator's execute (only when debugging do we need to ""materialize"" the list first).

This is a follow-up after #32494 and #32463, where autodetection of
docker context has been added. There is a weird relation between
builders and docker context - sometimes they have to be used in sync,
and sometimes not. For example when we are creating a new context
manually (airxflow_cache) to build images in parallel on ARM/x86,
we should use airflow_cache as buider, but the context should
remain ""default"". On the other hand when we are using ""desktop-linux""
builder, we MUST switch the context to ""desktop-linux"".

This PR is an attempt to make best effort to switch to the same
context as the builder, but instead of failing, we just warn
if can't and continue.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-10T17:30:34Z"

Recently Docker Desktop - particularly on Mac OS disabled creation of
/var/run/docker.sock by default, leaving it only as advanced option,
thus deprecating the ""default"" context for docker.

So far we recommended to enable the option for Breeze, but this change
allows to autodetect if there is a ""desktop-linux"" context available
(which uses a user-home-dir socket instead of the global /var/run one)
and if it gets detected, ""desktop-linux"" context is used.

This is slightly more complicated, because we need to also leave the
``--builder`` available for cases where our auto-detection fails,
so we need to expose the option in all commands that might attempt
to build image automatically, we also need to find and forward the
right socket to inside breeze - as we cannot unconditionally forward
the /var/run/docker.sock.

Alongside the chage ""static-checks"" command gets the same capability
of rebuilding the CI image automatically.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-09T18:56:09Z"

So far we've been checking if there are no ""unknown"" warnings
generated during provider import check, but this has proven to be
rather useless other than occasionally annoying everone with failing
main when new warnings have been introduced by a dependency.

There was likely not a single time when seeing those new warnings
have been actionable or useful other than adding them to the
exclusion list.

Removing the warning check seems to be reasonable thing to do.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-07-08T18:30:40Z"

This is a follow-up on #18616 where we introduced retries on the
occassional deadlocks when rendered task fields have been deleted
by parallel threads (this is not a real deadlock, it's because
MySQL locks too many things when queries are executed and will
deadlock when one of those queries wait too much).

Adding retry - while not perfect - should allow to handle the
problem and significantly decrease the likelihood of such
deadlocks.

We can probably think about different approach for rendered fields,
but for now retrying is - I think - acceptable short-term fix.

This commit sanitizes the DagRun.run_id parameter by introducing a configurable option.

generation performed by the scheduler for scheduled DAG runs or for Dag runs triggered without

* Update security model of Airflow

This change updates the security model of Airflow to better explain
what are the capabilities of various kinds of users in Airflow
deployments and give both users and security researchers a way to
understand what security measures they can take and whether they
can qualify potential security issues in Airflow properly - taking
into account that various users of Airflow have various capabilities
and behaviours considered by some of the users as security
vulnerabilities, are standard capabilities of the users.

It also splits the security information of ours in two separate
pages:

* .github/SECURITY.md where we explain how to report the issues
  to Apache Airflow security team by the researchers

* documentation security/index.html which is available via
  Airflow Website where we explain what our security model is
  and the different kinds of users we have.

Both serve slightly different purpose and both contain cross-reference
links to each other in order to be able to redirect people who read
about the security model to find out how they can report the issues
but also to guide security researchers who want to assess whether
their findings are real vulnerabilities, or rather normal behaviours
following the Airflow Security model.

Security has been also moved to be a top level topic, so that it
is easier to find and navigate to. Old links have been redirected
to the new locations.

Also chapters were added explaining Airflow vs. Providers security
releases, what is the relation between Airflow and Providers
security issues and how users should treat security announcements
in providers.

The ""advanced logging configuration"" applies not only to task
logs but also to component logs and you can use it not only to
configure custom way how task logs are created but also custom
way how ""regular"" component logs are created.

This has been a source of confusion for those who wanted
to configure (for example) elasticsearch or opensearch for the
whole airflow deployment, because the ""advanced configuration""
and how to modify standard configuration chapter was a small
section in ""task logging"".

This change extracts ""advanced logging configuration"" to separate
page right under the ""logging and monitoring"" and directs the
user from the ""task"" logging section to this page. It also
adds a bit more explanation on how standard Python logging
framework is leveraged here and links to Python logging documentation
for those who never used it before, to understand more about
Loggers, Handlers and Formatters.

When #15330 added docker.task, it also optimized replacement of the
callable with it's result in LazyDictWithCache. LazyDictWithCache
is used by Provider's Manager to optimize access to hooks - basically
hook is only actually imported, when it is accessed. This helps with
speeding up importing of connection information

The optimization added result of running callable to _resolved
set, but it missed the case when None was returned. Previously,
when None was returned, the callable was not replaced and it
was called again. After the change - the _resolved set was
updated with the key and None was returned. But since the key
has not been replaced, next time when the same key was retrieved,
the original ""callable"" was returned, not the None value. So if
callable returned None, and the same key was retrieved twice, the second
time, instead of None, the dictionary returned Callable.

This PR fixes it by setting the value to dictionary even if it
was None.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-29T07:09:19Z"

The executor_class in job was used in the past to pass information
about executor being used but it has been replaced by executor
passed via JobRunner when needed. The executor_class has only
been used in backfill job, but it has been used wrongly - because
it had no fully qualified path there.

The right way of using it is to check the executor passed via
JobRunner, and since executor_class is not used any more, we
can safely remove it.

This fixes a bug when custom exceutors could not be used
during backfill.

The changelong in provider docs has been part of the README which
became part of the page displayed in `PyPI` as well as the main
page displayed when you want to see provider documentation. This
was fine when the changelog was short, but with providers history
growing, the main page became longer and longer and the generated
index on the right side (from the changelog) became less and less
usable, and changelog itself became far less discoverable.

This change introduces another approach. Changelog gets its
own, separate page and it has quite a few positive consequences:

1) we can add separate ""Changelog"" URL in PyPI so that it is
   prominently visible at the TOC in PyPI URLS
2) we can link to the changelog easily from stable page - without
   worrrying which version we link to
3) the README file is part of the package so fixing the changelog
   in case of a doc-only mistake will not fix the PyPI page (it
   will only be fixed in future releases)
4) the link tree on the right side of the provider index page becomes back
   usable
5) the left-side TOD  on the provider's index page containes two
   prominent links that were missing: Home (back to the index provider
   page), Changelog, and Security - all under ""Basics"" link
6) The TOC is not repeated in the index page itself, making the content
   immediately visible rather than having to scroll trough the long
   TOC (in some cases like amazon the TOC was reallly long).","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-27T17:05:35Z"

The current behavior is to fetch all logs and only keep the last message(s)
This is wasteful, as there is an option to fetch from the end directly, allowing to send only the minimum number of requests.
Since a generator is used in get_log_events, stopping the iteration after we've collected enough logs prevents it from doing more requests.

With this change, we can expect less API calls & faster execution time for this method, especially in tasks that emit a log of logs.","Raphaël Vandon","vandonr@amazon.com","2023-06-26T23:56:17Z"

The ""Helm Unit Tests"" are special case of tests - they do not
run airflow code, they are merely runnig `helm` to process the
chart templates with various combinations of parameters. As such,
they do not contribute to coverage of Airflow Python code, and they
do not generate warnings when the code is run so there is no point
in attempting to upload coverage and warnings after the tests
complete. This even generates warnings currently in Job summary:

> Unit tests Helm: other
> No files were found with the provided path: ./files/warnings-*.txt. No
> artifacts will be uploaded.

There is no real cleanup we need after those tests because we are
not running containers during those tests, so we can safely just
remove cleanup steps - not even fix-ownership that helps to deal
with files that are created with root owner during container
based jobs.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-04T13:13:07Z"

The provider documentation for all community providers follows
the same structure. This PR adds pre-commit that verifies that
some common structure for all provider documentation is in place
and is properly indexed. Since we are adding a lot of providers
now, it's worth making a common pre-commit that will verify, and

not discoverable via ""airflow providers executors"" CLI - this is also
verified now.

removed from Airflow - instead the documentation points to the
common ""providers"" documentation where list of packages and links

on how to update and refresh the actions.

The changes:

* The `github-push-action` is not needed any more. As of newe versions
  of checkout action we can persist credentials and `fetch-depth: 0` to
  avoid `detached-head` problem that was there in previous versions and
  we can simply `git push` the committed changes. Alongside, the name
  of folder where we check constraints is changed to a much more
  explicit ""constraints"" from ""repo"" folder.

* The `configure-aws-credentials` is updated to latest version and
  careful review of the code in the commit has been done in order to
  verify it contains no malicious code and following best practices,
  SHA of the commit is used to checkout the action code.
  See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas
  The `configure-aws-credentials` organisation is also ""verified partner"" by
  GitHub so we can rather safely assume it is legitimate to upgrade.

* Github standard `checkout` action is updated to latest v4

* We still had `get-workflow-origin` submodule defined even if we
  have not used for a year now. All Submodule definition is now
  removed from airflow as none of the actions uses submodules to
  check out the actions any more.

* Update .github/workflows/ci.yml

We are fixing ``pip`` version during the CI building process to
install Airflow - in both CI and PROD image, and it is used to
run Airflow. However in PROD image we are copying the `.local`
folder with installed airflow and this folder does not contain
`pip` as `pip` is installed in the main environment. As result
the verison of `pip` in the final image was different than the
one fixed by the build process.

This did not have too bad consequences as `pip` generally works
even with older versions and the base images have rather recent
version of `pip` preinstalled, however for consistency we should
upgrade `pip` to latest version after copying the .local folder.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-11-02T23:06:06Z"

* Fix pre-mature evaluation of tasks in mapped task group

Getting the relevant upstream indexes of a task instance in a mapped task group
should only be done when the task has expanded. If the task has not expanded yet,
we should return None so that the task can wait for the upstreams before trying
to run.
This issue is more noticeable when the trigger rule is ONE_FAILED because then,
the task instance is marked as SKIPPED.

This PR switches the formatter we use from Black to Ruff, now that Ruff's introduced a [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/). The Ruff formatter is ~30x as fast as Black, and we already use Ruff for linting. This PR also upgrades the version of Ruff to the latest.

Note that this doesn't swap the formatter used in inline Python code in the docs as I haven't seen an easy way of getting the Ruff formatter working with it.

This PR marks DB tests as such and allows to split execution
of the tests in CI to run the DB tests with the various database
while the non-db tests - without the DB in a separate run.

In order to do that, the code to select which tests to run has been
moved from `entrypoint_ci.sh` bash to breeze's Python code, which is
generally much nicer to maintain and common for both ""DB"" and
""non-DB"" tests.

This will have the nice side effect that it will be easier in the
future to manage different test types and contain some specific
flaky test types.

This change also adds possibility to isolate some of the test types
when parallel DB tests are run and adds new test type
PythonOperator carved out Operator type. This test is best run in
isolation becasue creating and destroing virtualenvs in Docker while
running in parallel to other tests is very slow for some reason and
leads to flaky tests.

Python operator tests are therefore separated out from Operators and
treated separately as isolated tests.

This will help not only with speed but also with stability of the
test suite.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-10-31T20:52:06Z"

When we build the image with timeout, we fork the process and set alarm
and create a new process group in order to be sure that all the parallel
build processes can be killed easily with sending termination signal to
process group on timeout. In order to wait for the forked process
to complete we used waitpid, but we did not handle the status code
properly, so if the build failed, we returned with 0 exit code.

This had the side effect that ""Build CI image"" did not fail, instead
the next step (generating source providers failed instead and it was
not obvious that the CI image build failing was the root cause.

exit code - since we are still supporting Python 3.8 this is still
done using a bit nasty set of if statements - only in Python 3.9 we

The new docker desktop has an explicit configuration to enable
docker socket. We are using it for multiple things - not only to
get docker commands to run but also to forward docker socket to
inside the containers (docker-in-docker), also kind uses it
internally, so having the socket enabled is prerequisite for
Breeze.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-24T09:22:21Z"

The `start-airflow` command uses fork to start parallell asset
compilation in the background so that it can happen while docker
compose initializes. Unfortunately this fork child did not have
sys.exit() so it returned from the function and continued to run
second docker-compose in the background. In case asset compilation
was not needed this could happen in parallel and both processes
attempted to start two docker-compose commands in parallel.

This was not visible in ""dev"" mode - because asset compilation
never completed there also - when asset compilation was needed,
it took some time before it completed, and the effect of it were
not visible, because the forked process did not get terminal
output (it has been taken over by tmux by the time it started to
use it) and could not grab forwarded ports, so it was running but
largely invisible.

However when asset compilation was not needed, the two processes
started to do the same things at the same time - so a lot of
the output has been duplicated and for example the line output
has been broken because the same messages were overwriting over
each other and canceling the effect of EOL printed to terminal.

With this change, the forked process exits as soon as the
asset compilation is completed and does not repeat the same
steps that the parent process is doiing.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-24T09:04:16Z"

Some providers are excluded for some versions of Python (for example
the `apache.hive` provider is excluded on Python 3.11. However
this might make some pre-commits confused when running on Python 3.11
because the list of generated extras will be different for them
than those on other Python versions.

We do not want to set python used in pre-commits to, say, python3.8,
because that would mean that would require our users to have python3.8
as binary available on their system, which is not always setup. Python3
on the other hand is going to be universally available.

In order to mitigate the problem we will run the precommits with
_SKIP_PYTHON_VERSION_CHECK variable set before import of setup is done,
so that the python version check is skipped and all python versions
will produce the same set of extras.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-16T17:24:52Z"

* Update documentation for constraints installation

Airlow constraints and custom depenencies are a mystery for our
users. The reason why we are using constraints is not clear and
user are confused when they should and when they shoudl not use
constraints. Recent discussions with users and ""Mastering Custom
Dependencies"" presentation in London has proven that we need to
do better and simplify the documentation while giving more, better
examples. That includes trimming down of boilerplate description
in the constraint information, explaining a little more on what
reproducibke (not repeatable!) build is, adding expectation that
users will not use constraints for all pip commands and explaining
how to produce your own constraints if you need a reproducible,
custom build.

This PR aims to fulfill those goals.

In case MSSQL tests are run on public runners, they often produce
flake tests due to some race conditions that are difficult to fix.

The issue for the flake tests is captured in #31575

Likely the race conditions are resulting from attempt to run only
one scheduler loop and they are not impacting production. Also the
MSSQL tests are rarely run on public runners - only for PRS that
have ""full-tests-needed"" set, so slowing down the tests in those
cases is better than having flakes.

There are couple of changes needed to make our CI works for
PRs done internally in a private repository.

1) When you run PR to the same repository, the images can be built
without ""pull_request_target"" workflow - they can be built
in ""test"" workflow. The check we had hard-coded it to check
against ""apache/airflow"" repository, but the check will work for
non apache/airflow repos by just comparing base and target repositories.
If they are the same, it means that PR is done to own repository and
it should be fine to build images in-workflow.

2) The private repos require authentication before pulling the image
from repository - this is also fixed in this PR as commands that
only pulled the image did not require to authenticate before, but now
they have to authenticate. It turns out that passing --username being
actor might cause authentication to not allow to pull images, instead
a placeholder ""$"" has been used, which allowed to remove the
parameter altogether.

3) We also disable ""build-images"" jobs if github repository is different
than ""apache/airflow"" so that you do not run it needlessly in your
private PR.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-06-04T18:29:18Z"

1. no longer need getattr since mappedoperator has the attributes
2. the line `leaf_tis = list(set(leaf_tis) - set(teardown_tis))` drew my attention to the question, why weren't we using sets in the first place? So i switched to use sets. since there's a lot of `in` logic, good chance it's at least not worse, and it's a tiny bit cleaner this way.

This commit addresses an issue related to utilizing lists within the setup/teardown context manager.
To enable the usage of a list of tasks on the right-hand side of the context manager,
a new function called context_wrapper has been introduced. This is a subclass of 'list' that has
 the functionality of a context manager. Users will need to utilize this wrapper whenever they intend
to use a list within the RHS of the context manager.

* Refactor sqlalchemy queries to 2.0 style (Part 1)

This commit updates the sqlalchemy queries to adopt the 2.0 query style,
which is compatible with version 1.4. The changes involve updating the engine
with the future=True flag to indicate the execution of queries using the 2.0 style.
As a result, textual SQL statements are wrapped with the text function.

In addition, queries that previously used delete and update operations have been
modified to utilize the new delete/update construct. Furthermore, all queries within the
jobs/ and api/ directories have been thoroughly updated to employ the new style queries.

Please note that this commit intentionally stops at this point to ensure ease of review for the pull request.
The only test change is the addition of the future flag to the create_engine function.

PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27755 introduced sending triggerer
health status in the `/api/v1/health` endpoint and also updated relevant
docs but we've the primary `/health` too which is missing this information.
The PR addresses this missing status report for triggerer health in the
`/health` endpoint. It also attempts to deduplicate the code between those
endpoints so that in future we need to make necessary changes in only one
place and at the same time ensure that change made in one endpoint is not
missed for the other endpoint serving the same purpose and thus ensuring
consistency in the responses.

In the last wave of providers #31416 we bumped min-airlfow-version to 2.4 and
added mechanism to verify min-airflow version is ok while importing, but
it turned out that there are cases where installing just old version of
airflow (with no constraints) brings the latest version of those
providers and causes new installation of airflow to fail. This is far
too common to ignore or require to use constraints, unfortunately  We do
not have min-airlfow-version in the preinstalled providers for one
reason only. For some tools that are NOT conforming to standards (such
as bazel), having min-airflow-version for those providers causes
circular dependency (even though technically dependencies in PyPI can -
and often are - circular, because dependencies in Python are not DAG and
can contain cycles.

This was in response to this issue in 2021 #17795.

However, this is really  bazel issue, and on top of it - it's recognized
as such and being fixed very recently
in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1188 because there
are other packages that have similar problems (pytorch and triton being
popular couple). Also Bazel is not that popular in the Python world. 

Therefore, rather than trying to workaround the problem of bazel, we
encourage them to merge and release the fix
https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/1166#issuecomment-1558690218
and call it out in our installation instructions, that bazel
installation might lead to problems like that.

If bazel does not fix it, this will only be a problem for Future
installations of airflow in a few months most likely. It will not impact
current bazel users installing old versions of Airflow (actually they
might start having problems now if we do not fix it and yank the 5
providers released yesterday)","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-05-23T09:11:01Z"

We used to have low number of Public runners on GitHub actions and
Apache Software Foundation projects were competing for them, that's
why we switched `build-images` workflow to run on self-hosted
runners, and we had to add workflow-embedded list of committers to
make sure that build-info also uses self-hosted runners.

Recently however the ASF has 900 runners and if anything, it's the
public runners that are in abundance, while self-hosted runners are
limited, which sometimes leads to ""Wait for CI images"" jobs timeout
while waiting for self-hosted runners to build the image.

Those ""wait-for-ci-images"" jobs do almost nothing, just waiting, so
using self-hosted runners for those is not needed, we can easily
switch those to public runners as well.

Also ""wait-for-ci-images"" currently performs ""test-pytest-collection""
as an optimisation - preventing multiple ""test"" jobs from failing in
case of pytest collection fails, however with public runners, it adds
extra 4 minutes to tests, and failing pytest collection is rather rare
case, so we can safely remove this step.

This PR does the following changes:

* build-info jobs always run on public runners
* wait-for-ci-images job are always run on public runners
* wait-for-ci-images does not run test for pytest collection
* all the other jobs run on either self-hosted or public runners
  depending who the actor is (committers - run on self-hosted,
  non-committers, run on public runners)","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-05-22T17:41:24Z"

* Replace daemon Thread in dev-mode of breeze start-airflow with forking

When you run the dev mode for Breeze start-airlfow the webpack to
compile the assets is run in the background and should be stopped
as soon as the main process leaves. This has been done via daemon
Thread, however it turns out that when daemon thread gets stopped
at exit, it is stopped pretty abruptly. Quoting

https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html ::

> Note Daemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources
(such as open files, database transactions, etc.) may not be released
properly. If you want your threads to stop gracefully, make them
non-daemonic and use a suitable signalling mechanism such as an Event.

This also means that if the daemon threds starts a subprocess, the
thread is killed but the subprocess is not - the subprocess gets
orphaned and gets adopted by init process and continues running.

Tis PR replaces the mechanism with forking. Instead of running
thread, it will fork a new process that will run the compilation
(including starting the subprocess that runs it). It will also
change group for the started forked process to be the same as
the new pid, which creates a new process group and register
an atexit method to send TERM to all the processes belonging to
that grop, so even if the node process that runs compilation does
not propagate the TERM signal (it does not) to the webpack processes,
all the webpack processes share the same process group and get the
SIGTERM signal.

* Fix GCS system tests

* Fix CloudBuild unit test

* Update BigTable operators to accomodate for new dependencies.

* Fix Cloud Tasks System tests

Tasks dag was quite flaky without the retry option in the run_task step,
but it's consistently green with the option set.

We also add a GCP_APP_ENGINE_LOCATION env variable since this depends on
the used GCP Project App Engine's location

* Add setup docstring to Tasks system tests.

Changes:
- added wait_for_operation_complete() method to check the execution flow

This test has not worked because of slack channel and credentials not
being setup. We now test the same operators by creating notification
channels and policy alerts against pubsub topics, which don't need to
exist before the test is ran, making the test self-contained.

There are several improvements for the docker-compose tests of ours.
They have not been well documented and explained, also they had problems
with running in the new docker-comppose v2 environment. The healthcheck
failures were not easy to debug as well when they failed in CI.

This PR fixes all the problems:

* TESTING.rst describes the tests explains how they work and provides
  instructions on how to reproduce them locally and debug them

* The test now check which version of docker-compose is available and
  act accordingly (both v2 and v1 version are automatically supported)

* When the test fails, additionally to docker compose logs and
  process status, the state of all health checks is dumped so that
  it is clear why the health check failed

* A way is added to not shut down docker-compose after the test
  complete, which allows to inspect them

Some of the scheduler tests tried to prevent DAG processor processing DAGs
from ""tests/dags"" directory by setting processor_agent to Mock object:

```python
   self.job_runner.processor_agent = mock.MagicMock()
```

This, in connection with scheduler job cleaning all the tables and
approach similar to:

```python
        dag = self.dagbag.get_dag(""test_retry_handling_job"")
        dag_task1 = dag.get_task(""test_retry_handling_op"")
        dag.clear()
        dag.sync_to_db()
```

Allowed the test to run in isolated space where only one or few
DAGS were present in the DB.

This probably worked perfectly in the past, but after some changes
in how DAGFileProcessor works this did not prevent DAGFileProcessor
from running when _execute method in scheduler_job_runner has been
executed, and standalone dag processor was not running, the
processor_agent has been overwritten by a new DagFileProcessor
in the `_execute` method of scheduler_job_runner.

```python
        if not self._standalone_dag_processor:
            self.processor_agent = DagFileProcessorAgent(
                dag_directory=Path(self.subdir),
                max_runs=self.num_times_parse_dags,
                processor_timeout=processor_timeout,
                dag_ids=[],
                pickle_dags=pickle_dags,
                async_mode=async_mode,
            )
```

This led to a very subtle race condition which was more likely on
machines with multiple cores/faster disk (so for example it
led to #35204 which appeared on self-hosted (8 core) runners and
did not appear on Public (2-core runners) or it could appear on
an 8 core ARM Mac but not appear on 6 core Intel Mac (only on
sqlite)

If the DAGFileProcessor managed to start and spawn some
parsing processes and grab the DB write access for sqlite and those
processes managed to parse some of the DAG files from tests/dags/
folder, those DAGs could have polutted the DAGs in the DB - leading
to undesired effects (for example with test hanging while the
scheduler job run attempted to process an unwanted subdag and
got deadlocked in case of #35204.

The solution to that is to only set the processor_agent if not
set already. This can only happen in unit tests when the
`processor_agent` sets it to Mock object. For ""production"" the
agent is only set once in the `_execute` methods so there is no
risk involved in checking if it is not set already.

The #35099 switched installation of the local venv for Airflow to
released packages, in order to accomodate for case from #34729 where
we locally install a new provider that is preinstalled but has not
yet been released.

This however has the side-effect - some k8s tests are using K8S Pod
operator to run the tests and if this operator has been changed, the
local - modified - version of it is not going to be used for tests.

Another side effect is that in case of a new installation, when the
constraint installation does not work (for example constraints in
main are conflicting with released airflow), `pip` starts to
backtrack - and for conflicting requirements it produces strange
results (for example it attempts to install airflow 1.10 and fails
due to ""slugify"" dependency.

The previous version of it had another problem - once installed,
it had not changed, so in case someone used breeze to run k8s tests
locally and iterated over changes in K8SPod Operator, only the
version from the moment the k8s environment was installed was used.

Both cases are now handled better:

* INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES is used as env variable to make
  sure new providers (including preinstalled providers) are found
  in Airfow sources, not in PyPI
* The ""."" is used back in order to install Airflow but also the
  -e (editable) installation is used for it - so that any changes
  to local version of k8s are used. We are not using constraints
  for installation.
* Dry run and verbose mode of installing the venv are improved
  a bit - they show better what's going on (and dry_run does
  not interact with the installation in unexpected ways - deleting
  the installed venv without recreating it).

We already handled a change that k8s test environment has been
reinstalled after the requirements file changed and caching in CI
includes the hash of the requirements file as content - so we do not
need to handle reinstallation of the venv or caching in CI. The
venv should be appropriately reinstalled as needed.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-10-26T09:05:01Z"

Python 3.12 has a few breaking changes comparing to earlier versions.
While 3.7 - 3.11 were largely backwards compatible, Python 3.12 is the
first one for a long time that started to break things more
aggressively.

For now we know that Airflow will not work with Python 3.12 mainly
because of distutils removal (https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/) and
not because of Airflow's usage of it but pendulum's before version 3.

While we are working on getting Pendulum 3 support in #34744 and
the #34746, there are likely other dependencies that have similar
issue.

* Add Code Coverage Helper Tool for Airflow

- Facilitates local code coverage tracking for select areas.
- Displays reports at https://localhost:280808/dev/coverage/index.html for the particular area for easy access.
- Can also help in running tests in groups.

Supported areas:
- Core
- REST API
- CLI
- WWW

How to run the commands:
- python scripts/cov/core_coverage.py
- python scripts/cov/restapi_coverage.py
- python scripts/cov/cli_coverage.py
- python scripts/cov/www_coverage.py

Note:
- Tool can only be run within the Breeze environment.
- A list of modules that are not fully covered is available in the command code
- If a module achieves full coverage, the tool flags an error, so the module is removed from the list of not yet fully covered.
- Also if a module at 100% coverage goes below, the tool flags it and asks that it should be improved.

Currently, the coverage is not enforced even on the CI. It's currently just for anyone who want to work on some module's coverage

We have been using a labelling scheme where just ""self-hosted"" label

now provides self-hosted runners managed by them when we want to

more fine-grained distinction between the runners.

This will also be helpful when we switch to new runners based on k8s,

So far, we regenerated the constraints in order to get them
updated in constraint branches at the end of the CI build when we
knew all the builds succeded. However this was not perfect for
two reasons:

* there was a race condition that a dependency had been released
  between the time images were built and tests completed. While
  it had no impact on ""source"" constraints (they reflect what is
  in the image), it could change the PyPI constraints generated
  or ""no-providers"" constraints, because they use ""current"" set
  of dependencies in PyPI to generate them.

* generating constraints (for PyPI and ""no-providers"") takes time
  because `pip` has to resolve dependencies again - taking into
  account what is in the PyPI registry, and this can take a long
  time (minutes or even it can lead to long `pip` backtracking.
  We generally cancel running builds when new commit is merged in
  main, so this could lead to such constraint job being canceled
  by subsequent merge

This PR uses the fact that we have now ""preview-constraints"" job
that uploads constraints as artifacts in CI workflow, and instead
of regenerating the constraints, we can download the constraints
from uploaded artifact and use it - this is very quick and we can
also make a clear dependency between ""preview"" and ""update""
constraints jobs - making it clear in case of PIP backtracking
that we have problem with constraints, not with the image. This
will make it far clearer when we will have problems with constraints
and backtracking that this is the real issue we have (allowing
such PRs to get merged while constraints backtracking problem is
being worked on.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-10-18T14:08:53Z"

The sentry-sdk 1.32.0 released on 11th of October fixed handling of
utcnow to make it future-compatible with Python 3.12. The breadcrumb
timestamp returned was naive and now it is timezone aware with
utc specified explicitly as timezone. This broke our tests.

The change in sentry that impacted it is
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2415

We use the opportunity also to bump sentry sdk minimum version
to be 1.32.0 from very old 0.8.0 (from 2019). Sentry is a service, so
they generally always want you to use the latest version, and sentry has
very little requirements on its own to cause conflicts (for Python
3.8+ it only requires ""certifi"" without any specific limitations)","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-10-14T17:38:50Z"

with ""NoSuchProcess"" exception. For example in:
https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/6194862351/job/16819105464

The root cause of it was a race condition - when the process
exited after we retrived the list of processes but before we attempted
to kill it, creating of Process object failed with NoSuchProcess.

This PR catches such exceptions individually and let the iteration
process continue with killing other processes.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-09-15T14:33:54Z"

This change bumps the minimum SQLAlchemy version to 1.4.28 but it also
adds a special test job that only runs on Postgres that downgrades
the SQLAlchemy to the minimum supported version (retrieved from
setup.cfg). This way, we will be able to detect such incompatible
changes at the PR time. This is a new flag `--downgrade-sqlalchemy`
on test command that works similar to earlier `--upgrade-boto`.

We also enable the `--upgrade-boto` and `--downgrade-sqlalchemy` flags
to be used for `breeze shell` command - thanks to that we can
easily test both flags with `breeze shell` command.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-09-12T09:49:56Z"

The docker-compose tests are failing occassionally and part of it
is that we were manually waiting and querying for the compose
to be ready. Since we moved to docker compose v2 only we can now
remove the conditional docker-compose v1 code and use `--wait`
and `--wait-timetout` built-in functionality and increase the
timeout a bit. This should be helpful to avoid a race condition
where the docker components are started but not healthy yet, the
flag `--wait` waits not only for the processes to start but also
for the health checks.

Also increased the timeout of waiting for dags to be in
terminal state.

The query param `tab` is set on the DAGs view when any of the tabs _within_ the details panel is selected, thus we should show the details panel, even if the user previously hid it.

There are 2 main scenarios where a user would navigate to such a link:
1. User clicks on one of the pills on the DAG view (Graph, Gantt, Code). Imo, the user will expect to see the relevant tab in the details panel, even if they have it hidden.
2. User clicks on a link (e.g. from DAG runs, or someone sharing a link). Less clear cut than scenario 1, but still I think the most user friendly result is to show the requested tab (in the details panel).","Usiel Riedl","usiel.riedl@automattic.com","2023-09-07T09:58:37Z"

The `render_template_fields` method of mapped operator needs to use
database session object to render mapped fields, but it cannot
get the session passed by @provide_session decorator, because it is
used in derived classes and we cannot change the signature without
impacting those classes.

So far it was done by creating new session in mapped_operator, but
it has the drawback of creating an extra session while one is
already created (remnder_template_fields is always run in the
context of task run and it always has a session created already
in _run_raw_task). It also causes problems in our tests where
two opened database session accessed database at the same time
and it cases sqlite exception on concurrent access and mysql
error on running operations out of sync - likely when the same
object was modified in both sessions.

This PR changes the approach - rather than creating a new session
in the mapped_operator, we are retrieving the session from one
stored by the _run_raw_task. It is done by context manager and
adequate protection has been added to make sure that:

a) the call is made within the context manager
b) context manageer is never initialized twice in the same
   call stack

After this change, resources used by running task will be smaller,
and mapped tasks will not always open 2 DB sesions.

As documented in #33323, we have frequent failures of the flaky
triggerer job tests.

The flaky failures are about some errors when we close all the
sessions in teardown of the test. It turns out that the tests
had side-effect - they have not waited for the TriggererJob thread
to complete, they merely marked them to be stopped, but they have
not waited for those to complete - this is quite plausible
explanation of the flaky test failures - since those threads have
1 second sleep, it's more than likely that the session has been
created and used by the thread while the teardown has been attempting
to close all the sessions.

This side effect could also have an effect for other tests that
were run after - because in a busy test run machine, the side
effects could propagate further than just to the teardown, so it
could also explain why sometimes (very rarely) other job tests
failed with similar errors.

The fix is to join the runner after marking it to be stopped.

PR #31872 tried to optimise the deferrable mode in BigQueryValueCheckOperator.
However for deciding on whether to defer it just checked the
job status but did not actually verified the passed value
to check for and returned a success prematurely.
This PR adds on the missing logic with the optimisation to check
and compare the pass value and tolerations.

* Fix issue with unit tests in subprocesses on Mac

When unit tests are run on local virtual env on macOS, a lot of them fail because mocks do not work as expected when they are used in subprocesses.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods
""Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the spawn start method is now the default (...)"". On Unix systems ""fork"" is the default.

When you mock a method with patch() in unittest.mock, this mock will be accessible in subprocess only if the start command was ""fork"" and not ""spawn"".
I don't know how many tests were affected by it, for me, it was test_scheduler_job.py.

Moved config to conftest.py and enable only in macOS

The `devel_only` extra puts together all dependencies that are
needed for CI image and in order to run tests in local virtualenv
for various test cases of ours - but they are not needed as dependencies
of particular providers. They were a little ""bag of everything""
and they were hiding some unused dependencies or dependencies that
were either unused or they were actually provider dependencies already.

For example we had qds-sdk dependency there which was really the
qubole provider dependency and it held us back from removing
deprecated boto library from CI image (removed in #33889).

This PR organizes the dependency a bit better:

* split it to logical groups
* removes some unused dependencies
* moves ""amazon"" mypy dependency from providers to here

At later stage we will move the provider ones into ""[devel]"" extras
of the providers as part of provider decooupling, but this
will require a bit more changes in CI image building and some
documentation update for developers. This is an intermediate step
to organize it better.","Jarek Potiuk","jarek@potiuk.com","2023-08-31T05:35:28Z"
